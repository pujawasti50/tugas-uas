            <p>If this is my classmate when I was still in school, this is the one I miss the most until now because this is a time that can't be repeated because there are so many memories and people that I miss and all my close friends left a markNo matter how fun my college friends are and how complete the facilities are in college, I prefer my school bench even though it's not as good as collegeLastly, I miss my teachers who are always patient in teaching and facing my class even though we often cause problems and often hurt their feelings</p>
