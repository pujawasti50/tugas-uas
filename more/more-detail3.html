            <p>This beach is famous for its beautiful sunset so that many visitors want to come and the beach is also like the beaches in Bali. This beach is quite wide and the photo spots are quite good, only the entrance fee is a bit expensive. This beach is very clean from garbage and well-maintained so that many visitors feel at home. This is a beach that I want to visit every time, it's just hindered by the distance because it's too far </p>
